=======
Game Interface:

Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that displays the blackjack table, cards, and relevant game information.
Include buttons for actions like "Hit" (to request another card), "Stand" (to end your turn), "Double Down" (to double your bet and receive one more card), and "Split" (if the initial two cards have the same value).
Show the player's and dealer's hands clearly, with the option to toggle between face-up and face-down cards for the dealer's hand.
Display the player's current balance and the betting amount.
Game Logic:

Implement the core rules of blackjack, including card values (e.g., face cards are worth 10, Ace can be 1 or 11), dealing, and determining hand values.
Handle player actions and validate their inputs, such as allowing a "Hit" or "Stand" only when appropriate.
Apply the dealer's actions based on the predetermined rules (e.g., dealer hits on 16 or less, stands on 17 or more).
Deck Management:

Create and manage a deck of 52 cards, including shuffling and dealing cards to the player and the dealer.
Implement mechanisms to prevent the reuse of cards until the deck has been fully utilized.
Betting System:

Enable players to place bets before each hand.
Implement a mechanism to handle wins, losses, and pushes (ties).
Update the player's balance accordingly.
Game Flow:

Manage the flow of the game, including initiating a new round, resolving the hand outcome, and transitioning between different game states (e.g., player's turn, dealer's turn, hand resolution).
Visual Feedback and Animations:

Add visual effects and animations to enhance the gaming experience, such as card flipping, card movement, and chip stacking.
Game State Persistence:

Implement a mechanism to save and load the game state, allowing players to resume their progress if they close the game or refresh the webpage.
Responsive Design:

Ensure the game is optimized for different screen sizes and devices, allowing players to enjoy the game on both desktop and mobile platforms.
Sound Effects and Music (optional):

Consider adding sound effects for actions like card dealing, button clicks, and winning/losing hands.
Include background music to enhance the overall atmosphere.
